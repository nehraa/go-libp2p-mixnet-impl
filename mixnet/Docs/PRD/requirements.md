# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Lib-Mix is a high-performance, sharded, configurable-hop mixnet protocol for libp2p that provides metadata-private communication at near-wire speeds. The protocol addresses the fundamental trade-off between privacy and performance in decentralized applications by using multi-path sharding and configurable onion routing. It operates as a transport-agnostic stream upgrader that can be toggled on by libp2p developers when metadata privacy is required without sacrificing application performance.

---

## IMPLEMENTATION-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS

The following requirements were added during implementation to address real-world deployment concerns not covered in the original design.

---

### Requirement 21: Optional CES Pipeline

**User Story:** As a libp2p developer, I want to disable the CES pipeline for low-latency applications, so that I can reduce overhead for small messages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Lib_Mix_Protocol SHALL accept a configuration parameter `use_ces_pipeline` (default: true)
2. WHEN `use_ces_pipeline` is false, THE Lib_Mix_Protocol SHALL skip compression
3. WHEN `use_ces_pipeline` is false, THE Lib_Mix_Protocol SHALL skip Reed-Solomon erasure coding
4. WHEN `use_ces_pipeline` is false, THE Lib_Mix_Protocol SHALL encrypt the payload and split it evenly across circuits
5. WHEN `use_ces_pipeline` is false, ALL circuits MUST succeed for data delivery (no redundancy)

**Implementation Rationale**: For small messages (<1KB) or latency-sensitive applications, the CES pipeline overhead exceeds its benefits. This flag allows simpler deployments.

---

### Requirement 22: Header Padding

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious user, I want headers to be padded, so that observers cannot fingerprint relay positions by header size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Lib_Mix_Protocol SHALL accept configuration parameters `header_padding_enabled`, `header_padding_min`, and `header_padding_max`
2. WHEN `header_padding_enabled` is true, THE Lib_Mix_Protocol SHALL add random padding to privacy headers
3. THE padding size SHALL be uniformly random between `header_padding_min` and `header_padding_max` bytes
4. THE Lib_Mix_Protocol SHALL default to `header_padding_enabled = true` for better privacy protection by default
5. THE Lib_Mix_Protocol SHALL default to `header_padding_max = 256` bytes when enabled

**Implementation Rationale**: Without header padding, header size reveals hop count and relay position, enabling traffic analysis attacks.

---

### Requirement 23: Payload Padding

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious user, I want payload padding, so that message sizes don't leak information about content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Lib_Mix_Protocol SHALL support three payload padding strategies: `none`, `random`, and `buckets`
2. WHEN `payload_padding_strategy` is `random`, THE Lib_Mix_Protocol SHALL add random padding between `payload_padding_min` and `payload_padding_max` bytes
3. WHEN `payload_padding_strategy` is `buckets`, THE Lib_Mix_Protocol SHALL round up payload size to the nearest value in `payload_padding_buckets`
4. THE Lib_Mix_Protocol SHALL default to `payload_padding_strategy = none` for backward compatibility
5. THE Lib_Mix_Protocol SHALL validate that bucket sizes are in ascending order

**Implementation Rationale**: Message size patterns leak information (e.g., "typing" vs "sending file"). Padding breaks size-based correlation attacks.

---

### Requirement 24: Authenticity Tags

**User Story:** As a libp2p developer, I want optional authenticity tags on shards, so that I can detect corruption or tampering early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Lib_Mix_Protocol SHALL accept configuration parameters `enable_auth_tag` and `auth_tag_size`
2. WHEN `enable_auth_tag` is true, THE Lib_Mix_Protocol SHALL compute an HMAC tag for each shard
3. THE Lib_Mix_Protocol SHALL use HMAC-SHA256 truncated to `auth_tag_size` bytes (default: 16)
4. THE Lib_Mix_Protocol SHALL verify authenticity tags before shard reconstruction
5. THE Lib_Mix_Protocol SHALL reject shards with invalid authenticity tags

**Implementation Rationale**: Encryption provides confidentiality but not integrity verification at intermediate hops. Authenticity tags enable early detection of corruption or malicious relays.

---

### Requirement 25: Timing Obfuscation

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious user, I want random delays between shard transmissions, so that observers cannot correlate shards by timing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Lib_Mix_Protocol SHALL accept a configuration parameter `max_jitter` in milliseconds
2. WHEN `max_jitter` > 0, THE Lib_Mix_Protocol SHALL add a random delay between 0 and `max_jitter` ms before transmitting each shard
3. THE Lib_Mix_Protocol SHALL use a cryptographically secure random number generator for jitter
4. THE Lib_Mix_Protocol SHALL default to `max_jitter = 50` (50 ms of timing noise for correlation resistance by default)
5. THE jitter SHALL be applied independently to each shard transmission

**Implementation Rationale**: Without jitter, observers can correlate shards across circuits by arrival time, breaking unlinkability.

---

### Requirement 26: Resource Management

**User Story:** As a Relay_Node operator, I want comprehensive resource management, so that my node remains stable under attack.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Relay_Node SHALL implement a ResourceManager component
2. THE ResourceManager SHALL track active circuit count and bandwidth usage
3. THE ResourceManager SHALL reject new circuits when `max_circuits` is reached
4. THE ResourceManager SHALL apply backpressure when bandwidth limits are approached
5. THE ResourceManager SHALL expose metrics for current resource utilization

**Implementation Rationale**: The original design mentioned resource limits but didn't specify enforcement. Implementation showed this is critical for DoS protection.

---

### Requirement 27: Metrics Collection

**User Story:** As a libp2p developer, I want comprehensive metrics, so that I can monitor and debug my deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Lib_Mix_Protocol SHALL collect metrics for circuits established, failed, and recovered
2. THE Lib_Mix_Protocol SHALL collect metrics for shards transmitted, received, and failed
3. THE Lib_Mix_Protocol SHALL collect metrics for bytes transmitted and received
4. THE Lib_Mix_Protocol SHALL calculate average circuit RTT and compression ratio
5. THE Lib_Mix_Protocol SHALL expose metrics via a MetricsCollector interface

**Implementation Rationale**: The original design mentioned metrics but didn't specify what to collect. These are the critical metrics for production operation.

---

### Requirement 28: Failure Detection

**User Story:** As an Origin peer, I want proactive failure detection, so that circuits are recovered before data loss occurs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Lib_Mix_Protocol SHALL implement a CircuitFailureNotifier component
2. THE CircuitFailureNotifier SHALL allow registration of failure callbacks
3. THE Lib_Mix_Protocol SHALL monitor circuit health via periodic heartbeats
4. WHEN a circuit fails, THE Lib_Mix_Protocol SHALL invoke registered callbacks
5. THE Lib_Mix_Protocol SHALL attempt automatic circuit recovery when possible

**Implementation Rationale**: The original design relied on passive failure detection (timeout on send). Active monitoring enables faster recovery.

---

### Requirement 29: Session Management

**User Story:** As a Destination peer, I want to handle multiple concurrent streams, so that I can support multiple clients simultaneously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Lib_Mix_Protocol SHALL implement a DestinationHandler component
2. THE DestinationHandler SHALL maintain separate shard buffers per session ID
3. THE DestinationHandler SHALL maintain separate encryption keys per session ID
4. THE DestinationHandler SHALL implement per-session timeouts
5. THE DestinationHandler SHALL clean up stale sessions after timeout

**Implementation Rationale**: The original design assumed single-stream operation. Real-world use requires concurrent connections.

---

### Requirement 30: Protocol Versioning

**User Story:** As a libp2p developer, I want protocol versioning, so that I can upgrade without breaking existing deployments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Lib_Mix_Protocol SHALL include a version field in all protocol frames
2. THE Lib_Mix_Protocol SHALL support version `0x01` (full onion encryption)
3. THE Lib_Mix_Protocol SHALL support version `0x02` (header-only encryption)
4. THE Lib_Mix_Protocol SHALL reject frames with unsupported version numbers
5. THE Lib_Mix_Protocol SHALL allow future version additions without breaking changes

**Implementation Rationale**: The original design assumed a single protocol version. Versioning is essential for protocol evolution.

---

### Requirement 31: Transport Capability Detection

**User Story:** As a libp2p developer, I want to detect supported transports, so that I can choose the optimal transport for each peer.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Lib_Mix_Protocol SHALL implement a DetectTransportCapabilities function
2. THE function SHALL parse peer multiaddrs to extract supported transports
3. THE function SHALL return a TransportInfo struct with supported protocols
4. THE Lib_Mix_Protocol SHALL verify peers support standard transports (TCP, QUIC, WebRTC)
5. THE Lib_Mix_Protocol SHALL provide a SupportsStandardTransport helper function

**Implementation Rationale**: The original design assumed libp2p handles transport selection automatically. Explicit detection improves reliability and debugging.
